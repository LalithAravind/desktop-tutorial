 # Guidelines for writing error messages: 
# 1. Mention the problem, the cause, and the solution/next step user has to perform to resolve the problem.
# 2. End the sentence with a period, if it is a complete sentence.  
# 3. Use Click instead of Click on.
# 4. Avoid redundant words, such as "please" and "successfully" that do not add any value to the message. For example, instead of "Please contact...", write "contact..."
# 5. Start the messages with an action word, as far as practicable. For example, write "Submitted Job" instead of "Job is submitted".
